I am Jakob Meyer. I love computers, music, games and movies. I live in Moore, Oklahoma and have all of my life. Before I got my associates degree I had a son. This required me to get a job that could pay to support my family which delayed my schooling. But now I am in a comfortable state in my life so I am back in school chasing some dreams.
